# The VBA of Wall Street

# Project background

# Objective
The aim of this project is to develop VBA Script to produce summary table  which displays ticker symbols, yearly change, percent change and total stock volume with their corresponding tickers and values, given Wall Street stock market data of years 2014 through 2016 using VBA Scripting. The given data are ticker symbols, opening and closing prices for each years,volume sales and others. And apply conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red using VBA colorIndex.

# VBA SCRIPT 
VBA Script that will loop through all the stocks within given years which displays the following information was developed;

. The ticker symbol.


. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


. The total stock volume of the stock.


. Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red was developed.

. Adjustment has been done to VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

Moreover, as bonus part greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume with their corresponding tickers and values were created among given dataset. And the same VBA script developed above was applied to another data file named Alphabetical_Testing_WSH.xlsm and its included in the repository. 



VBA script for excel dataset file named Multi_year_stock_data_WSH.xlsm is available in the repository.

# SAMPLE RESULTS 
Runnning the VBA Script will result in the following sample pictures taken from the first page of many pages attached below for each years. The remainig can be found by running the main VBA Script file in repository.
