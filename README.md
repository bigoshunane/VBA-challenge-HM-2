# VBA_CHALLENGE_HM2
This project work analyzed given stock market data of years 2014 through 2016 using VBA Scripting. The given data are ticker symbols, opening and closing prices for each years,volume sales and others.
The aim was to develop VBA Script to produce summary table  which displays ticker symbols, yearly change, percent change and total stock volume with their corresponding tickers and values. 
# VBA SCRIPT

-Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red was developed.

Moreover, as bonus part greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume with their corresponding tickers and values were created among given data set. And the same VBA script developed above was applied to another data file named Alphabetical_Testing_WSH and its included in the repository. 



VBA script is available in excel data file named Multi_year_stock_data_WSH in the repository.

# SAMPLE RESULTS 
Runnning the VBA Script will result in the following sample pictures taken from the first page of many pages attached below for each years. The remainig can be found by running the main excel file in repository.
